# Face mask detector
A real-time face mask detection system based on MobileNetV2

## Usage
Before using the script, install the necessary packages by creating the anaconda environment from the environment.yml file.

To use the laptop webcam to do real-time mask detection, simply run the file with no arguments. 

```bash
python face_mask_detector.py
```

To detect all the masks in an image, run the file with the flag -i or --image and supply an absolute image path
